# naapuri

Go implementation and library of Linux's `ip monitor neigh` which lists ARP/MAC address changes on network interfaces.

# Why?

For example:

* Automatically add new firewall rules
* Automatic inventory discovery
* Find intruders
* Configure per-mac address VLANs to your switch(es)
* Gather statistics when device(s) are (dis)connected to/from a network
* Send MAC address to a database
* Send alert(s) when MAC address X is not seen for a while
* etc...
